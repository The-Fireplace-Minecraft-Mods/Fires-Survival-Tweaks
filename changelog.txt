Rewritten for Fabric and 1.16.3/2
Greatly improved the slime-related options
Added option for magma cubes to turn back into slimes when they get wet
Replaced the buggy old Rockslide mechanics with a new cave-in system
Removed Real Stone Tools, Craftable Horse Armor, and Stair Recipe Replacement
Enabled using Pick Block on spawners if the mod is installed on the client
Temporarily removed Silverfish Ore Gen, it will most likely return for Minecraft 1.17
